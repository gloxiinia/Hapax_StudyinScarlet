47. CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.
48. 
49. 
50. IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
51. University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course
52. prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,
53. I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant
54. Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before
55. I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at
56. Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and
57. was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many
58. other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
59. in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
60. entered upon my new duties.
61. 
62. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
63. nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
64. attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of
65. Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which
66. shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have
67. fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the
68. devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a
69. pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.
70. 
71. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
72. undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
73. the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved
74. so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little
75. upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse
76. of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and
77. when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and
78. emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost
79. in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the
80. troopship "Orontes," and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with
81. my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal
82. government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.
83. 
84. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
85. air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will
86. permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to
87. London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of
88. the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at
89. a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless
90. existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely
91. than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that
92. I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate
93. somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in
94. my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making
95. up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less
96. pretentious and less expensive domicile.
97. 
98. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
99. the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning
100. round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at
101. Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is
102. a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never
103. been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,
104. and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the
105. exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and
106. we started off together in a hansom.
107. 
108. "Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in
109. undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
110. "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."
111. 
112. I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it
113. by the time that we reached our destination.
114. 
115. "Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
116. misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"
117. 
118. "Looking for lodgings." [3] I answered. "Trying to solve the problem
119. as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
120. price."
121. 
122. "That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second man
123. to-day that has used that expression to me."
124. 
125. "And who was the first?" I asked.
126. 
127. "A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.
128. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone
129. to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which
130. were too much for his purse."
131. 
132. "By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms and
133. the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner
134. to being alone."
135. 
136. Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. "You
137. don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not care
138. for him as a constant companion."
139. 
140. "Why, what is there against him?"
141. 
142. "Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer
143. in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I
144. know he is a decent fellow enough."
145. 
146. "A medical student, I suppose?" said I.
147. 
148. "No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well
149. up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,
150. he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are
151. very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way
152. knowledge which would astonish his professors."
153. 
154. "Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.
155. 
156. "No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
157. communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."
158. 
159. "I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I
160. should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
161. enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
162. Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
163. could I meet this friend of yours?"
164. 
165. "He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He either
166. avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to
167. night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon."
168. 
169. "Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
170. channels.
171. 
172. As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford
173. gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to
174. take as a fellow-lodger.
175. 
176. "You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know
177. nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in
178. the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me
179. responsible."
180. 
181. "If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It
182. seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that you
183. have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's
184. temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it."
185. 
186. "It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a laugh.
187. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to
188. cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of
189. the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,
190. but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea
191. of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself
192. with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and
193. exact knowledge."
194. 
195. "Very right too."
196. 
197. "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
198. subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
199. rather a bizarre shape."
200. 
201. "Beating the subjects!"
202. 
203. "Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him
204. at it with my own eyes."
205. 
206. "And yet you say he is not a medical student?"
207. 
208. "No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we
209. are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke, we
210. turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which
211. opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,
212. and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and
213. made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed
214. wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage
215. branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.
216. 
217. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
218. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
219. test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.
220. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant
221. table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round
222. and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. "I've found it! I've
223. found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a
224. test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is precipitated
225. by hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else." Had he discovered a gold mine,
226. greater delight could not have shone upon his features.
227. 
228. "Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.
229. 
230. "How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
231. for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in
232. Afghanistan, I perceive."
233. 
234. "How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.
235. 
236. "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is about
237. hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of
238. mine?"
239. 
240. "It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but
241. practically----"
242. 
243. "Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
244. Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come
245. over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and
246. drew me over to the table at which he had been working. "Let us have
247. some fresh blood," he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and
248. drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. "Now, I
249. add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that
250. the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion
251. of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,
252. that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction." As he
253. spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added
254. some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a
255. dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom
256. of the glass jar.
257. 
258. "Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
259. child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"
260. 
261. "It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.
262. 
263. "Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
264. uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The
265. latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears
266. to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been
267. invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long
268. ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."
269. 
270. "Indeed!" I murmured.
271. 
272. "Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
273. suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
274. linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.
275. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,
276. or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,
277. and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock
278. Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty."
279. 
280. His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
281. heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
282. imagination.
283. 
284. "You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at his
285. enthusiasm.
286. 
287. "There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
288. certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was
289. Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,
290. and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it
291. would have been decisive."
292. 
293. "You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a
294. laugh. "You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News
295. of the Past.'"
296. 
297. "Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock
298. Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.
299. "I have to be careful," he continued, turning to me with a smile, "for I
300. dabble with poisons a good deal." He held out his hand as he spoke, and
301. I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,
302. and discoloured with strong acids.
303. 
304. "We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high
305. three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with
306. his foot. "My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
307. complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought
308. that I had better bring you together."
309. 
310. Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with
311. me. "I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which would
312. suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco,
313. I hope?"
314. 
315. "I always smoke 'ship's' myself," I answered.
316. 
317. "That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally
318. do experiments. Would that annoy you?"
319. 
320. "By no means."
321. 
322. "Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
323. times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am
324. sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What
325. have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the
326. worst of one another before they begin to live together."
327. 
328. I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said, "and
329. I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts
330. of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices
331. when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present."
332. 
333. "Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked,
334. anxiously.
335. 
336. "It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a treat
337. for the gods--a badly-played one----"
338. 
339. "Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may
340. consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
341. you."
342. 
343. "When shall we see them?"
344. 
345. "Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
346. everything," he answered.
347. 
348. "All right--noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.
349. 
350. We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards
351. my hotel.
352. 
353. "By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, "how
354. the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?"
355. 
356. My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. "That's just his little
357. peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he
358. finds things out."
359. 
360. "Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very piquant.
361. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of
362. mankind is man,' you know."
363. 
364. "You must study him, then," Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
365. "You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more
366. about you than you about him. Good-bye."
367. 
368. "Good-bye," I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
369. interested in my new acquaintance.
370. 
371. 
372. 
373. 
374. CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.
375. 
376. 
377. WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,
378. [5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They
379. consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large
380. airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad
381. windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate
382. did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was
383. concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.
384. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the
385. following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and
386. portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and
387. laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we
388. gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new
389. surroundings.
390. 
391. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet
392. in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be
393. up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out
394. before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical
395. laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long
396. walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.
397. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but
398. now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would
399. lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving
400. a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such
401. a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him
402. of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance
403. and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.
404. 
405. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his
406. aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and
407. appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual
408. observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively
409. lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and
410. piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;
411. and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of
412. alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness
413. which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably
414. blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of
415. extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe
416. when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.
417. 
418. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how
419. much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured
420. to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned
421. himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how
422. objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.
423. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was
424. exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and
425. break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I
426. eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and
427. spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.
428. 
429. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,
430. confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to
431. have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in
432. science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance
433. into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,
434. and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample
435. and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man
436. would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some
437. definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the
438. exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters
439. unless he has some very good reason for doing so.
440. 
441. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary
442. literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.
443. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he
444. might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,
445. when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory
446. and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human
447. being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth
448. travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact
449. that I could hardly realize it.
450. 
451. "You appear to be astonished," he said, smiling at my expression of
452. surprise. "Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it."
453. 
454. "To forget it!"
455. 
456. "You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is
457. like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture
458. as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he
459. comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets
460. crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that
461. he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman
462. is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will
463. have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of
464. these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It
465. is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can
466. distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every
467. addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is
468. of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing
469. out the useful ones."
470. 
471. "But the Solar System!" I protested.
472. 
473. "What the deuce is it to me?" he interrupted impatiently; "you say
474. that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a
475. pennyworth of difference to me or to my work."
476. 
477. I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something
478. in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I
479. pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw
480. my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which
481. did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he
482. possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own
483. mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was
484. exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.
485. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran
486. in this way--
487. 
488. 
489. SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.
490. 
491.   1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.
492.   2.              Philosophy.--Nil.
493.   3.              Astronomy.--Nil.
494.   4.              Politics.--Feeble.
495.   5.              Botany.--Variable.  Well up in belladonna,
496.                               opium, and poisons generally.
497.                               Knows nothing of practical gardening.
498.   6.              Geology.--Practical, but limited.
499.                                Tells at a glance different soils
500.                                from each other.  After walks has
501.                                shown me splashes upon his trousers,
502.                                and told me by their colour and
503.                                consistence in what part of London
504.                                he had received them.
505.   7.              Chemistry.--Profound.
506.   8.              Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.
507.   9.              Sensational Literature.--Immense.  He appears
508.                               to know every detail of every horror
509.                               perpetrated in the century.
510.   10. Plays the violin well.
511.   11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
512.   12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.
513. 
514. 
515. When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.
516. "If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all
517. these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,"
518. I said to myself, "I may as well give up the attempt at once."
519. 
520. I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These
521. were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.
522. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because
523. at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other
524. favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any
525. music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of
526. an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle
527. which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and
528. melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they
529. reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided
530. those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim
531. or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against
532. these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them
533. by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a
534. slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.
535. 
536. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think
537. that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,
538. however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most
539. different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,
540. dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came
541. three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,
542. fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same
543. afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew
544. pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely
545. followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old
546. white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on
547. another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these
548. nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to
549. beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.
550. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. "I have
551. to use this room as a place of business," he said, "and these people
552. are my clients." Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank
553. question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to
554. confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for
555. not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to
556. the subject of his own accord.
557. 
558. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I
559. rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not
560. yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my
561. late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With
562. the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt
563. intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table
564. and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched
565. silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the
566. heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.
567. 
568. Its somewhat ambitious title was "The Book of Life," and it attempted to
569. show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic
570. examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a
571. remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was
572. close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched
573. and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch
574. of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts.
575. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one
576. trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible
577. as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear
578. to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had
579. arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.
580. 
581. "From a drop of water," said the writer, "a logician could infer the
582. possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of
583. one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is
584. known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,
585. the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired
586. by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal
587. to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to
588. those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest
589. difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary
590. problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to
591. distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to
592. which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the
593. faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look
594. for. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his
595. trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his
596. expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling
597. is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the
598. competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable."
599. 
600. "What ineffable twaddle!" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the
601. table, "I never read such rubbish in my life."
602. 
603. "What is it?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
604. 
605. "Why, this article," I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat
606. down to my breakfast. "I see that you have read it since you have marked
607. it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It
608. is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these
609. neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not
610. practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class
611. carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his
612. fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him."
613. 
614. "You would lose your money," Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. "As for
615. the article I wrote it myself."
616. 
617. "You!"
618. 
619. "Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The
620. theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so
621. chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend
622. upon them for my bread and cheese."
623. 
624. "And how?" I asked involuntarily.
625. 
626. "Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the
627. world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.
628. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private
629. ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to
630. put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I
631. am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of
632. crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about
633. misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger
634. ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade
635. is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a
636. forgery case, and that was what brought him here."
637. 
638. "And these other people?"
639. 
640. "They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are
641. all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little
642. enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and
643. then I pocket my fee."
644. 
645. "But do you mean to say," I said, "that without leaving your room you
646. can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they
647. have seen every detail for themselves?"
648. 
649. "Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case
650. turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and
651. see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge
652. which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.
653. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your
654. scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is
655. second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our
656. first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan."
657. 
658. "You were told, no doubt."
659. 
660. "Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long
661. habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I
662. arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.
663. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a
664. gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly
665. an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is
666. dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are
667. fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says
668. clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and
669. unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have
670. seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The
671. whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you
672. came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished."
673. 
674. "It is simple enough as you explain it," I said, smiling. "You remind
675. me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did
676. exist outside of stories."
677. 
678. Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. "No doubt you think that you are
679. complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin," he observed. "Now, in my
680. opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking
681. in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of
682. an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some
683. analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as
684. Poe appeared to imagine."
685. 
686. "Have you read Gaboriau's works?" I asked. "Does Lecoq come up to your
687. idea of a detective?"
688. 
689. Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. "Lecoq was a miserable bungler,"
690. he said, in an angry voice; "he had only one thing to recommend him, and
691. that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was
692. how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four
693. hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for
694. detectives to teach them what to avoid."
695. 
696. I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired
697. treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood
698. looking out into the busy street. "This fellow may be very clever," I
699. said to myself, "but he is certainly very conceited."
700. 
701. "There are no crimes and no criminals in these days," he said,
702. querulously. "What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know
703. well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has
704. ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural
705. talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the
706. result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy
707. with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see
708. through it."
709. 
710. I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it
711. best to change the topic.
712. 
713. "I wonder what that fellow is looking for?" I asked, pointing to a
714. stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the
715. other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had
716. a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a
717. message.
718. 
719. "You mean the retired sergeant of Marines," said Sherlock Holmes.
720. 
721. "Brag and bounce!" thought I to myself. "He knows that I cannot verify
722. his guess."
723. 
724. The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were
725. watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across
726. the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps
727. ascending the stair.
728. 
729. "For Mr. Sherlock Holmes," he said, stepping into the room and handing
730. my friend the letter.
731. 
732. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little
733. thought of this when he made that random shot. "May I ask, my lad," I
734. said, in the blandest voice, "what your trade may be?"
735. 
736. "Commissionaire, sir," he said, gruffly. "Uniform away for repairs."
737. 
738. "And you were?" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my
739. companion.
740. 
741. "A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,
742. sir."
743. 
744. He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was
745. gone.
746. 
747. 
748. 
749. 
750. CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [6]
751. 
752. 
753. I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the
754. practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers
755. of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking
756. suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged
757. episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have
758. in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he
759. had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,
760. lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.
761. 
762. "How in the world did you deduce that?" I asked.
763. 
764. "Deduce what?" said he, petulantly.
765. 
766. "Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines."
767. 
768. "I have no time for trifles," he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,
769. "Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps
770. it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a
771. sergeant of Marines?"
772. 
773. "No, indeed."
774. 
775. "It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you
776. were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some
777. difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the
778. street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the
779. fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,
780. however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was
781. a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.
782. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung
783. his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of
784. him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant."
785. 
786. "Wonderful!" I ejaculated.
787. 
788. "Commonplace," said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he
789. was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. "I said just now that
790. there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!" He
791. threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]
792. 
793. "Why," I cried, as I cast my eye over it, "this is terrible!"
794. 
795. "It does seem to be a little out of the common," he remarked, calmly.
796. "Would you mind reading it to me aloud?"
797. 
798. This is the letter which I read to him----
799. 
800. 
801. "MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--
802. 
803. "There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,
804. off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in
805. the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something
806. was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare
807. of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and
808. having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber,
809. Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any
810. evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in
811. the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to
812. how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.
813. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find
814. me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.
815. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would
816. esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.
817. Yours faithfully,
818. 
819. "TOBIAS GREGSON."
820. 
821. 
822. "Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders," my friend remarked;
823. "he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and
824. energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives
825. into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional
826. beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put
827. upon the scent."
828. 
829. I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. "Surely there is
830. not a moment to be lost," I cried, "shall I go and order you a cab?"
831. 
832. "I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy
833. devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,
834. for I can be spry enough at times."
835. 
836. "Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for."
837. 
838. "My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the
839. whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will
840. pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage."
841. 
842. "But he begs you to help him."
843. 
844. "Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but
845. he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.
846. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my
847. own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!"
848. 
849. He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that
850. an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.
851. 
852. "Get your hat," he said.
853. 
854. "You wish me to come?"
855. 
856. "Yes, if you have nothing better to do." A minute later we were both in
857. a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.
858. 
859. It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the
860. house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets
861. beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away
862. about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and
863. an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the
864. melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
865. 
866. "You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand," I said at
867. last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.
868. 
869. "No data yet," he answered. "It is a capital mistake to theorize before
870. you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment."
871. 
872. "You will have your data soon," I remarked, pointing with my finger;
873. "this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much
874. mistaken."
875. 
876. "So it is. Stop, driver, stop!" We were still a hundred yards or so from
877. it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon
878. foot.
879. 
880. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was
881. one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being
882. occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant
883. melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and
884. there a "To Let" card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared
885. panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly
886. plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed
887. by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a
888. mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the
889. rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a
890. three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and
891. against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by
892. a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes
893. in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.
894. 
895. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the
896. house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be
897. further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the
898. circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up
899. and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the
900. opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,
901. he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass
902. which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice
903. he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation
904. of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey
905. soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was
906. unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.
907. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his
908. perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal
909. which was hidden from me.
910. 
911. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,
912. flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and
913. wrung my companion's hand with effusion. "It is indeed kind of you to
914. come," he said, "I have had everything left untouched."
915. 
916. "Except that!" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. "If a herd
917. of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No
918. doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you
919. permitted this."
920. 
921. "I have had so much to do inside the house," the detective said
922. evasively. "My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him
923. to look after this."
924. 
925. Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. "With two
926. such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be
927. much for a third party to find out," he said.
928. 
929. Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. "I think we have done
930. all that can be done," he answered; "it's a queer case though, and I
931. knew your taste for such things."
932. 
933. "You did not come here in a cab?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
934. 
935. "No, sir."
936. 
937. "Nor Lestrade?"
938. 
939. "No, sir."
940. 
941. "Then let us go and look at the room." With which inconsequent remark he
942. strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed
943. his astonishment.
944. 
945. A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.
946. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these
947. had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the
948. dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had
949. occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling
950. at my heart which the presence of death inspires.
951. 
952. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence
953. of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was
954. blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had
955. become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.
956. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of
957. imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a
958. red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was
959. hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was
960. intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.
961. 
962. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was
963. centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon
964. the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured
965. ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of
966. age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and
967. a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat
968. and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar
969. and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor
970. beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while
971. his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a
972. grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,
973. and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human
974. features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low
975. forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly
976. simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,
977. unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has
978. it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy
979. apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban
980. London.
981. 
982. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and
983. greeted my companion and myself.
984. 
985. "This case will make a stir, sir," he remarked. "It beats anything I
986. have seen, and I am no chicken."
987. 
988. "There is no clue?" said Gregson.
989. 
990. "None at all," chimed in Lestrade.
991. 
992. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it
993. intently. "You are sure that there is no wound?" he asked, pointing to
994. numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.
995. 
996. "Positive!" cried both detectives.
997. 
998. "Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]
999. presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of
1000. the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in
1001. the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?"
1002. 
1003. "No, sir."
1004. 
1005. "Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It
1006. has all been done before."
1007. 
1008. As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,
1009. feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same
1010. far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was
1011. the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness
1012. with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips,
1013. and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.
1014. 
1015. "He has not been moved at all?" he asked.
1016. 
1017. "No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination."
1018. 
1019. "You can take him to the mortuary now," he said. "There is nothing more
1020. to be learned."
1021. 
1022. Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered
1023. the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised
1024. him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed
1025. it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.
1026. 
1027. "There's been a woman here," he cried. "It's a woman's wedding-ring."
1028. 
1029. He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered
1030. round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of
1031. plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.
1032. 
1033. "This complicates matters," said Gregson. "Heaven knows, they were
1034. complicated enough before."
1035. 
1036. "You're sure it doesn't simplify them?" observed Holmes. "There's
1037. nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his
1038. pockets?"
1039. 
1040. "We have it all here," said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects
1041. upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. "A gold watch, No. 97163, by
1042. Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,
1043. with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes.
1044. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,
1045. corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose
1046. money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of
1047. Boccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the
1048. fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph
1049. Stangerson."
1050. 
1051. "At what address?"
1052. 
1053. "American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both
1054. from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their
1055. boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to
1056. return to New York."
1057. 
1058. "Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?"
1059. 
1060. "I did it at once, sir," said Gregson. "I have had advertisements
1061. sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American
1062. Exchange, but he has not returned yet."
1063. 
1064. "Have you sent to Cleveland?"
1065. 
1066. "We telegraphed this morning."
1067. 
1068. "How did you word your inquiries?"
1069. 
1070. "We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad
1071. of any information which could help us."
1072. 
1073. "You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to
1074. be crucial?"
1075. 
1076. "I asked about Stangerson."
1077. 
1078. "Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears
1079. to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?"
1080. 
1081. "I have said all I have to say," said Gregson, in an offended voice.
1082. 
1083. Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make
1084. some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we
1085. were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,
1086. rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
1087. 
1088. "Mr. Gregson," he said, "I have just made a discovery of the highest
1089. importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a
1090. careful examination of the walls."
1091. 
1092. The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in
1093. a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his
1094. colleague.
1095. 
1096. "Come here," he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of
1097. which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. "Now, stand
1098. there!"
1099. 
1100. He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.
1101. 
1102. "Look at that!" he said, triumphantly.
1103. 
1104. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this
1105. particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a
1106. yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was
1107. scrawled in blood-red letters a single word--
1108. 
1109.                          RACHE.
1110. 
1111. 
1112. "What do you think of that?" cried the detective, with the air of a
1113. showman exhibiting his show. "This was overlooked because it was in the
1114. darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The
1115. murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where
1116. it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide
1117. anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See
1118. that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was
1119. lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of
1120. the wall."
1121. 
1122. "And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?" asked Gregson in a
1123. depreciatory voice.
1124. 
1125. "Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name
1126. Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark
1127. my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a
1128. woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very well for
1129. you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but
1130. the old hound is the best, when all is said and done."
1131. 
1132. "I really beg your pardon!" said my companion, who had ruffled the
1133. little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. "You
1134. certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,
1135. and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other
1136. participant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to examine this
1137. room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now."
1138. 
1139. As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying
1140. glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly
1141. about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once
1142. lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that
1143. he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to
1144. himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire
1145. of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of
1146. encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded
1147. of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and
1148. forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes
1149. across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his
1150. researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between
1151. marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his
1152. tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place
1153. he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,
1154. and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass
1155. the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most
1156. minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he
1157. replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.
1158. 
1159. "They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains," he
1160. remarked with a smile. "It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to
1161. detective work."
1162. 
1163. Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur
1164. companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently
1165. failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that
1166. Sherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some
1167. definite and practical end.
1168. 
1169. "What do you think of it, sir?" they both asked.
1170. 
1171. "It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume
1172. to help you," remarked my friend. "You are doing so well now that it
1173. would be a pity for anyone to interfere." There was a world of
1174. sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. "If you will let me know how your
1175. investigations go," he continued, "I shall be happy to give you any help
1176. I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found
1177. the body. Can you give me his name and address?"
1178. 
1179. Lestrade glanced at his note-book. "John Rance," he said. "He is off
1180. duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate."
1181. 
1182. Holmes took a note of the address.
1183. 
1184. "Come along, Doctor," he said; "we shall go and look him up. I'll tell
1185. you one thing which may help you in the case," he continued, turning to
1186. the two detectives. "There has been murder done, and the murderer was a
1187. man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had
1188. small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a
1189. Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,
1190. which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his
1191. off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the
1192. finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a
1193. few indications, but they may assist you."
1194. 
1195. Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.
1196. 
1197. "If this man was murdered, how was it done?" asked the former.
1198. 
1199. "Poison," said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. "One other thing,
1200. Lestrade," he added, turning round at the door: "'Rache,' is the German
1201. for 'revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel."
1202. 
1203. With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals
1204. open-mouthed behind him.
